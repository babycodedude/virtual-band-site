VIRTUAL BAND — Starter Pack (Newspaper + VN Buttons)

How to run:
1) Open index.html in a browser (double-click). This pack is designed to work via file:// (no local server needed).

How to add content (template stays fixed):
- Add / edit articles: content/articles.js
- Add YouTube links & photos: content/media.js
- Update "system words" (button text in console): content/system_messages.js
- Add photos into: assets/media/images/

Notes:
- Intentionally no heavy libraries, no WebGL, no big video backgrounds.
- Interaction is button-only; effects are minimal for speed and consistency.
